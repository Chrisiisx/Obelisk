## 🗿 What is Obelisk?

**Obelisk** is an open-source password manager designed to be fully self-hosted with a single `docker-compose up`. The goal is to create a **zero-knowledge system** where teams and freelancers can share credentials securely without depending on external services like Firebase or managed databases.
